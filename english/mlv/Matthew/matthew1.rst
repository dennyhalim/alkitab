     1:1 The book of lineage of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: 1:2 Abraham fathered Isaac; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob fathered Judah and his brethren; 1:3 and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah from Tamar; and Perez fathered Hezron; and Hezron fathered Ram; 1:4 and Ram fathered Amminadab; and Amminadab fathered Nahshon; and Nahshon fathered Salmon; 1:5 and Salmon fathered Boaz from Rahab; and Boaz fathered Obed from Ruth; and Obed fathered Jesse; 1:6 and Jesse fathered David, the king.

     And David, the king, fathered Solomon from the widow of Uriah; 1:7 and Solomon fathered Rehoboam; and Rehoboam fathered Abijah; and Abijah fathered Asa; 1:8 and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram; and Jehoram fathered Uzziah; 1:9 and Uzziah fathered Jotham; and Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah; 1:10 and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; and Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah; 1:11 and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the exile of Babylon.

     1:12 And after the exile of Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel; and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel; 1:13 and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud; and Abiud fathered Eliakim; and Eliakim fathered Azor; 1:14 and Azor fathered Sadoc; and Sadoc fathered Achim; and Achim fathered Eliud; 1:15 and Eliud fathered Eleazar; and Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob; 1:16 and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called* the Christ.

     {Mat 1:1-17 & Luk 3:23-28 Mary’s Genealogy.}

     1:17 Therefore, all the generations from Abraham until David were fourteen generations; and from David until the exile of Babylon, were fourteen generations; and from the exile of Babylon until the Christ, were fourteen generations.

     {Mat 1:18-25 Nazareth 5 BC; no parallel.}

     1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: for* when* his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant {Greek: in womb holding} from the Holy Spirit. 1:19 Now Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not willing to disgrace her, planned to divorce her secretly. 1:20 But when* he was contemplating these things, behold, a messenger of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary to you, as your wife for* what was born {Or: conceived} in her is from the Holy Spirit. 1:21 Now she will be bearing a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for* he will be saving his people from their sins. 1:22 Now this whole thing has happened, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 1:23 ‘Behold, the virgin will be pregnant, and will be bearing a son, and they will call his name Immanuel'; which is, after being translated, ‘God with us.’ {Isa 7:14, 8:8, 10} 1:24 Now having been aroused from his sleep, Joseph did as the messenger of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to him; 1:25 and did not know her intimately until she bore her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.
