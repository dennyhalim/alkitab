     {Mat 2:1-12 Jerusalem & Bethlehem 4 BC; no parallel.}

     2:1 Now when* Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise-men {Persian Magi; v7 & v16} from the east came into Jerusalem, 2:2 saying, Where is he who has been born the King of the Jews? For* we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him. 2:3 Now when* Herod the king heard it, he was disturbed and everyone in Jerusalem with him. 2:4 And having gathered together all the high-priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ should be born.

     2:5 Now they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for* thus it has been written through the prophet, 2:6 ‘And Bethlehem, a land of Judah, you are by no means least among the governors of Judah; for* a leader will be coming forth from you, who will be shepherding my people Israel.’ {Mic 5:2, 2Sam 5:2}

     2:7 Then Herod, having called the wise-men secretly, ascertained accurately from them the time of the star’s appearing. 2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, While* you° are traveling, probe° out accurately the things concerning the young child. And whenever you° have found him, report° to me, *that I may also come and may worship him. 2:9 Now having heard the king, they traveled away. And behold, the star, which they saw in the east, was preceding them until it came and stood above where the young child was. 2:10 Now having seen the star, they rejoiced with extremely great joy. 2:11 And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother. They fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh to him. {Isa 60:6, Psa 72:10, 15} 2:12 And having been divinely-warned in a dream not to revisit Herod, they departed into their own region through another way.

     {Mat 2:13-18 Leaving for Egypt 4 BC; no parallel.}

     2:13 Now when* they had departed, behold, a messenger of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, When* you arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I should speak to you again, because Herod is about to seek the young child to destroy him. 2:14 Now he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt; 2:15 and they were there until the end of Herod; in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, ‘Out of Egypt I called my son.’ {Hos. 11:1} 2:16 Then Herod, having seen that he was mocked by the wise-men, was exceedingly furious, and sent forth soldiers and assassinated all the boys who were in Bethlehem, and in all her borders, from two years and downward, according to the time which he had ascertained accurately from the wise-men. 2:17 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 2:18 ‘A voice was heard in Ramah, mourning, and weeping, and much anguish, Rachel weeping for her children. And she did not wish to be comforted, because they are not there.’ {Jer 31:15}

     {Mat 2:19-23 & Luk 2:39b Egypt & Nazareth 4 BC.}

     2:19 But when* Herod was dead*, behold, a messenger of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 2:20 saying, When* you arise, take the young child and his mother, and travel into the land of Israel, for* those seeking the young child’s life have died. 2:21 Now he arose and took the young child and his mother and entered into the land of Israel. 2:22 But when* he heard that Archelaus is reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely-warned in a dream, he departed into the parts of Galilee, 2:23 and he came and dwelt in a city called* Nazareth; *that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he will be called a Nazarene.
